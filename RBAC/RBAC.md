Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Express.js
What is RBAC?
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is an authorization mechanism that restricts system access based on a user's role within an organization. It provides fine-grained control over what users can and cannot do in an application.

Key concepts:

Roles: Collections of permissions (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer)

Permissions: Specific actions users can perform (e.g., create_post, delete_user)

Users: Assigned one or more roles that determine their permissions
